#### What is Photoasis?
Photoasis is an online photo gallery that allows you to upload your photos along its EXIF data (it's camera settings, such as ISO and Aperture values). As an amateur photographer (more of a hobbyist, really), analyzing and comparing my photos to their camera settings has enabled me to improve my skills in properly exposing photos and capture better shots. Hence, I designed Photoasis as a platform document my growth in photography as well as a place to archive my most precious moments in life.
